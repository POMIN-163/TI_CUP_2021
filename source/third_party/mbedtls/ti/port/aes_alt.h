 *
 *  @brief      Hardware accelerated mbedtls aes implementation
 *
 *  # General
 *  This alternate aes implementation for mbedtls is intended to provide
 *  hardware acceleration on any SimpleLink platform that has implemented the
 *  AESECB and AESCBC driver APIs.
 *
 *  The implementation is based on the AESECB and AESCBC drivers and thus
 *  also requires any link-time dependencies they have.
 *
 *  # Limitations
 *  The replaced functions may only be called from Task context when using an
 *  operating system. The driver instances are set up to block until they
 *  acquire the mutex protecting the hardware from concurrent accesses. Blocking
 *  is only permitted in Task context. The upside of this is that none of the
 *  calls will return an error because they were unable to access the hardware
 *  immediately. The downside is of course that the functions may not be called
 *  from Hwi or Swi context.
